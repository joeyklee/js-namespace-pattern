# Javascript General Namespace Pattern

I first came across this javascript application pattern looking at some of [Chris's](https://clhenrick.io/) projects, specifically his [Bushwick community Map](https://clhenrick.io/work/bushwick-community-map.html), [code](https://github.com/clhenrick/BushwickCommunityMap). 

I thought it was a lovely way to structure the application in a way that used no framework. Just good 'ol fashioned code pattern organization. This is just a template as a reference.
